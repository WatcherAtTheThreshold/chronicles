# Apprentice to the East

*Ash stood looking out at the green field, the tall grass blowing in the wind. Small barn swallows dipped and looped in the sky. He scanned the tree line at the edge of the field. A large deer lifted its head; they looked at one another, and it darted into the woods.*

**Ash continued walking** down the dusty road, his cape swaying as he moved. His backpack and pack-roll snug against his back.  

The swallows reminded him of the chickadees that he used to feed at home. He missed them. More than twenty days had passed since he left home. He walked east in search of the knights Artorius, Siff, and Orion. He sought an apprenticeship.  

A cruxflare, a terrible beast of the night, killed his parents when he was young. He was an orphan raised by his aunt and uncle. As a child, he spent much of his time training. He wanted to defend the weak; he wanted to be a hero.  

He could see someone up ahead, standing on the side of the road, a long cape billowing in the wind. As he got closer, they appeared to be standing still. He walked up and stood in front of him. It was a robot, unmoving, coated with layers of gray road dust. Its tattered cloak flapped in the breeze.  

"Hello?" He said, leaning towards the automaton, seeing if it could communicate. A swallow swooped close to them.  

Ash tapped the robot's chest with his finger. A cloud of dust fell and was blown away in the wind.  

He walked away from the defunct robot.  

The road cut into the forest. The trees canopy forming a cathedral like ceiling. Sunlight spilled through the leaves dappling on the road.  

As soon as he entered the forest, he noticed small, cloaked figures, Kithren he guessed, darting behind trees keeping pace with him. He was being followed. He stopped; all of the watchers stopped as well. Ash took a few more steps; they started moving behind the trees again. He stopped again; they stopped again.  

Ash put his hands on his hips and stood still looking around. After a minute he folded his arms on his chest and just stood there. He stood still and they stood still.  

"OK, you can come out," he said, "I'm not moving until you do," Arms still folded. He cocked his head to the side and looked around. After a few minutes he gave up and just started walking again, they reminded him of the brave little chickadees back home.  

As he drew deeper into the woods, they seemed to be pushing ahead of him. They slowly moved ahead until he could no longer see them darting between the trees. Not much further down the road he could see what looked like chimney smoke rising into the air. A smaller, narrower trail branched off the main road. He could smell wood smoke. He walked down the narrow trail.  

On the smaller trail he had to push through encroaching brush, leaves and branches whipped his face as he moved forward. The village came into view. He walked up to the edge of town and called out "I don't want to cause any alarm, can I pass through your village, or even better can I talk to one of you?" He stood, waiting.  

"What do you want to talk about," a voice called back from an unknown location.  

"I'm looking for lodging for the night, maybe a place to sleep and a bite to eat, I may be too large for you to oblige and if so, I'll just move on", He looked around waiting for a response.  

A small, cloaked, Kithren creature, standing no taller than knee high, walked into view. "This is our home, it's called Longbrook. You're welcome to stay in peace." She stepped closer to Ash and bowed her head, "I am Elžbieta."  

"I am Ash, nice to meet you". Ash bent down and shook Elžbieta's hand.  

Others came out to get a look at Ash; they were all slight; they looked healthy, and they all looked happy. Their features were mouse-like, and they were covered with fur. Some wore cloaks, others wore pants and shirts, dresses and blouses. They were murmuring and whispering and glancing towards Ash.  

"I'm Ash," he said to the gathering crowd.  

One of them stepped forward and said, "I am Levant, if you are an adventurer we could use your help."  


 
Ash looked around at all the tiny creatures, moms, grandma's, aunts and uncles, and children. He couldn't say no; this was his fated duty. He would do what he could to help.  

"Tell me what's happening and I will try my best," Ash put his hands together, bowing and nodding a quiet 'yes'. Looking at the crowd, their eyes were brightening, and many started to smile. Ash thought about the knights and what they would do. This was a fitting test.  

"OK, well, I'll sleep right outside of town and eat my own food, I don't want your stores to run dry just so I can get a meal. But we can discuss what's happening over dinner. We'll see how I can help." Ash felt sure he'd be able to help whatever their problem was; he could defeat this village just by walking too fast.  

"Thank you, Ash, we will prepare somewhere for you to sleep," said Elžbieta.  

She turned to the crowd and waved to someone, "Tilly," Elžbieta motioned her over. A small, cloaked character stepped forward; Elžbieta leaned over towards her and said, "Gather helpers and construct a twig long-house for our guest tonight." Tilly knew exactly who to bring. She motioned to a small group; they stepped from the crowd, and Tilly led them off into the woods.  


 

The day was starting to cool as the sun dipped below the tree line. Small birds flittered and chirped about, collecting their last meal before nightfall. Ash wandered and found the brook that must be the town's namesake. He walked out on smooth stones. Upriver he could see the sunset; it's glow warm on his face. The water looked black in the twilight, offset by the bright gold reflections of the setting sun.  

He reached into the water; it was cold. Ash washed his hands and splashed his face. He dried himself using the inside of his cloak. A small character pushed out of the woods; it was Levant.  

"Hello Levant," said Ash, warmth in his voice.  

"Hi," said Levant as he walked over to the water, bending down to wash his hands and face. "Thank you for offering help," he said standing up, drying his hands and face with his apron.  

Ash hoped he could help. He smiled down at Levant, raised his eyebrows, and with his hand he motioned ahead. Together, they walked back to the village.  

 

Elžbieta and Tilly stood in town waiting for Ash; another fellow walked up, joining them.  

"Hello, I'm Milo," said the newcomer, Ash nodded a hello.  

"Let's show you to your sleeping quarters so you can put your pack down. Milo, here, is our local engineer," said Tilly  

"Sounds good," Ash was so warmed by these people. He felt right at home.  

Elžbieta, led the way. They didn't have to walk far when the trail forked; they headed down the new branch. It led to a clearing; at its center sat a newly constructed long-house.  

Before him sat a beautiful twig constructed building. Walls, a pitched roof, window hatches with props to hold them open. It was a squat building; he'd have to crouch to get in the door. Smoke puffed through a hole in the center of the roof. Through the open wide doors, he could see a small campfire at its center, leaving more than enough room to put his pack-roll beside it.  

"This is really beautiful; you didn't have to do all this for me." He looked at them wide-eyed. "You just built this tonight? You are all amazing!” Ash looked at it, his chin up, taking in its aesthetic beauty.  

"Milo here is the master builder, he's a bit of a genius," said Tilly, patting Milo on the back. Milo smiled and shrugged.  

Elžbieta followed up with, "a building like this is our traditional food drying barn; we build them for harvest. They work well for housing large folk like you; it'll keep you warm and dry.  

Ash slid his backpack off of his shoulder and set it inside. Removing the bedroll, he laid it out along the wall farthest from the door. He had to crouch to move around, but it was a warm place to sleep. He took off his cloak and laid it on the sleeping bag. Digging into his backpack, he pulled out a heavier over-shirt and his brown food pouch.  

He walked out to the others; they seemed happy with how impressed he was. Milo and Tilly walked around closing window hatches. Ash closed the double doors.  

"Let's go eat and discuss our problem." said Elžbieta, leading them back towards town.  



The dining hall was a similar size and shape to the sleeping quarters they had built for him, but this building was permanent. It had some kind of smooth mud coating the outer walls. All the buildings in town shared a similar white color. It had wide doors that he could fit through, but he still had to crouch to walk inside. Instead of twigs, the inside was built of chunky timber-frame planks. The floor was made with mud tile bricks, the same white color as the walls.  

A big spot was clear for him to sit down. Elžbieta, Levant, Tilly, and Milo sat near him. The entire village was gathered sitting in small groups, most already eating. There was a din of chatter; many were joking and laughing.  

Food was brought out to the five of them. Ash removed hard-bread and a small canteen from his pouch; he set the canteen down and placed the bread on his leg. What they served was a bowl of meat and vegetable stew, though it was only a few bites it went perfectly with his bread.  

"Let's hear your problem," said Ash, sipping his drink.  

"We think it's a witch problem," said Tilly. "She moved in near the swamp last year and has since flooded her section of the forest. This was fine but then a few months ago our livestock started to disappear. Then just days ago Imogen, a local farmer, disappeared too. We're pretty sure the witch is behind it. We're still searching for Imogen" Looking at Ash Tilly raised her shoulders and both hands, "what do you think, will you help?"  

"Do you know where this witch is?" asked Ash, feeling inspired to act, inspired to help.  

"I can take you there tomorrow, we can't go to her shack because of the flooded swamp, but we can see it, we'll search for Imogen too."  

Tilly seemed like a leader of the group, no, she was too young to be a leader. Maybe she was just smart and outspoken, making her a de facto leader. Ash liked her and liked that they would go together tomorrow.  

"I'm going to go to bed, thank you all very much for your hospitality," Ash said, then he scooched his way out of the dining hall.  

Ash walked alone in the dark back to the lodge they'd built for him. He opened the door, bending down to get in; it was warm inside. He thought about his good fortune, full belly, warm sleeping quarters, and soft ground. Tucked in, with a smile on his face he drifted off to sleep.  


 
The next morning, they woke up before sunrise and ate breakfast. Ash got to meet the livestock. Tilly called them cuy (coo•ee). Small furry mammals that Ash could have picked up in one hand. To Tilly they were as big as sheep. Tilly warned not to pet them and that they would bite.  

They left the corral and headed east out of town. In the distance, water birds sang haunting calls. The morning was misty; it grew thicker as they approached the swamps. A path branched to the left, downhill; they were moving into low country, into the mire. It was cool, and the damp mist made it sink in, chilling them; they pulled their cloaks tighter.  

The trail turned into a steep series of switchbacks. Then they went down a long set of stone stairs. Then there was a series of wooden ladders they had to climb down. When they reached the bottom, the ground was wet and soft, with moss and ferns.  

Tilly led them forward to the edge of the swamp. She pointed out into the mist over the water. Ash looked where she was pointing. There was a little shack on high stilts. He could barely make out a silhouette of a woman on the shack's porch.  

Downed trees crisscrossed the surface of the water. "We could try to cross the swamp on these trees." said Ash. He tried to step onto a tree, and it held his weight. He walked out to the next trunk, stepping onto it. It bobbed under the water. He quickly stepped back and balanced his way back to shore, jumping back onto solid ground.  

"Let's walk the shoreline, we should look for Imogen." Tilly started walking, Ash followed.  

"It's a bit strange that she flooded her house," said Ash, pondering. "I guess she did build it stilted off the ground. And it makes it a lot harder to get to if she's trying to keep people away."  

They continued skirting the edge of the swamp, moving farther and farther away from the witch's shack. Eventually the sun started to burn through the mist and patches of blue started to appear in the sky.  

They heard a ruckus from a stand of tall grass not far ahead. They both stopped and a bear stood. Ash and the bear looked at one another; it ran off into the woods. Ash's heart was beating hard.  

Something splashed in the water not far from the shore. They both looked out trying to see what it was. I guess it was nothing, Ash thought.  

A woman stepped out of the woods beside them. Ash jumped and Tilly yelled. The woman was eerily calm. Ash and Tilly looked at one another then back at the woman. Her long dark hair was perfectly smooth; her face was perfectly beautiful. Her colorful, earthy dress billowed about her strong agile form. She looked otherworldly; it scared them. She silently stared. Ash felt shaky, hands trembling, every hair on Tilly's body stood up straight.  

"I'm Ash!" He said with a tremble in his voice. It was all he could think of doing.  

Tilly followed up with, "I'm Tilly." They both looked around nervously. A barely perceptible smile spread across the woman's face.  

Tilly's eyes went wide; she looked up at Ash. "The Witch," She whispered, loud enough for all to hear, pointing to the woman. Ash flinched and his eyes widened. It hadn't occurred to him that she was 'the witch'.  

They looked at the woman, she closed her eyes and took a deep breath, when she re-opened them, she looked stern and mad. "I am Grimelda, I am the witch, this is my swamp... What are you doing in my swamp?" She straightened her posture and her fierce eyes softened, folding her hands together fingers interlocked, Tilly and Ash stepped away from her.  

Tilly, hackles still up, said, "What are you going to do to us?" Her feet were spread apart, shoulders raised; she was ready to defend against the witch's attack.  

The woman raised a hand towards Ash, and he fell limp onto the damp leaf litter and moss. Tilly audibly gasped, eyes wide. She moved over a step, positioning herself between Ash and Grimelda.  

"He is fine, he'll awaken in a minute or two," the witch paused taking another deep breath, "if he decided to act someone could have gotten hurt, so I put him to sleep," said Grimelda. The witch stepped right up to Tilly, looking down on her. Tilly shrank bracing for the witch's attack. "Do you search for a missing girl?" Grimelda asked.  

"Yes, Imogen, what did you do to her?" asked Tilly, her brow furrowed into a scowl.  

"Keep moving in this direction," Grimelda pointed in the direction they had been walking. "Your friend fell into a dam. She's trapped there, still alive, but only because she's hanging on!"  

The witch turned her back on Tilly and started to walk away. She looked back at the mouse-girl and said, "you don't have much time." Grimelda stepped into the trees, mist swirling around her. Right in front of Tilly, she just disappeared. The witch was gone and Tilly's fur laid back down. She peered around, assessing what to do next.  

Ash stirred and then sat right up. "I'm awake!" He looked around and stood up. "What happened?" He asked, rubbing his eyes.  

"Never mind that, I know where Imogen is, this way," and she pointed down the shoreline. "We need to hurry!" Tilly started running ahead, Ash followed. "She's trapped in the dam!" She said while running.  

"But the witch?" asked Ash, panting.  

"We need to hope she wasn't lying," said Tilly, breathing heavily as her feet scampered over the moss.  

"I can see it! A beaver dam!" Ash yelled and ran harder.  



"Imogen! Imogen!" They both called her name as they ran onto the dam. They both stopped; birds were chirping, and they could hear water trickling below.  

Underneath them they heard a faint, just whispering voice say, "help me, I'm here".  

Ash and Tilly with hope on their faces said, "We're here! We're going to get you out!  

Tilly started looking into the dam trying to spot Imogen in the tangle of trees. "Here, she's here!"  

Ash ran over, he spotted her and said, "We need to move those logs," and he started to move the interlocking pieces of wood.  

Imogen's legs were pinned, and she was half submerged. Ash climbed into the dam to get closer to her. He moved a log; more water started to pour over Imogen, splashing right over her head. She was struggling to breathe.  

"It's getting worse! She's drowning! We need to get her out of there!" Tilly cried in panic.  

Ash jumped over Imogen and pulled on the log that she was stuck under. He yelled and pulled with all his might. Tilly jumped down, pulling Imogen free.  

"She's out! She's out! We did it!" Yelled Tilly. She was smiling, tears were rolling down her cheeks.  

Ash, half soaked, dropped the log and climbed out, collapsing on the top of the dam. "We did it." He said with a smile.  

"Yes, we did it, the witch told the truth," Tilly said removing Imogen's cloak and wrapping her in her own.  

Ash picked up Imogen and the three started a brisk hike back to the village.  

They passed the spot where they could see the witches hut. Ash thought he saw her standing on her porch; she might have waved. Cradling Imogen Ash climbed the ladders and the stairs and all the switchbacks, then they were out of the swamp.  

"We're almost home," said Tilly, Imogen was conscious but barely.  

"Thank you," whispered Imogen as the trail opened up to the village. They were safe; they made it home.  

The villagers gathered around them looking joyful. Imogen was whisked away to be warmed and tended to. Ash and Tilly were triumphant.  

"Good job heroes," said Elžbieta. She gave Ash a hug and said, "thank you," she hugged Tilly extra tightly and said, "Good job." She wiped tears from her eyes. "I didn't think I'd see Imogen again; I wasn't sure if I'd see the two of you again either." wiping at another tear on her cheek. "You two get cleaned up and we'll talk about what happened with Imogen and the witch."  

Ash smiled and looked at Tilly. He had a glint in his eyes. Tilly smiled back.  

 

Ash went back to his sleeping hut and changed his clothes; he hung all the wet clothes to dry. Then he wandered down to the brook to wash up. Tilly was there.  

"Hey there adventurer," said Ash, Tilly giggled, Ash let out a little chuckle. "You did a really good job today, that got pretty scary." Ash started washing his hands. "Hey, what happened to me? The witch? I remember Grimelda raised her hand and that's it.”  

"Well, that's pretty much it. She raised her hand; you fell to the ground. She told me where Imogen was and said we had to hurry and that you'd only be out for a few minutes. Then she disappeared right in front of me, that was exciting. You woke up a minute or two later." Tilly nodded her head in a matter-of-fact way. "Did you notice the shoreline near Grimelda's shack? The water was receding; we must have opened the dam a bit."  

"Sorry I got so scared," Ash lowered his head.  

"You, so scared? I thought the witch was going to kill us, I was terrified." Tilly put her hands on her hips, "I think we both did good, if we hadn't gone Imogen would have died, we saved her life." Tilly looked deep into Ash's eyes. Ash nodded, yes.  

They walked back to the town center and found Elžbieta. Milo, Levant, and a small crowd approached them. Imogen walked out of a nearby building. The crowd cheered as she walked over; she hugged Ash and Tilly.  

Elžbieta looked at the three of them and asked, "Imogen, are you well enough to speak about what happened to you?" She raised her eyebrows questioningly.  

"Yes," Imogen replied. "I went to the swamp following an animal, a mink. I wanted to track it down to be sure. I was crossing the beaver dam and fell into it. Somehow in my struggle to get free, I ended up getting pinned by a log. I spent days partially underwater, shivering, and cold. Thank you two so much for saving me," Imogen started to cry softly. Elžbieta rubbed a comforting hand on her back.  

"Now the two of you. What happened down in the swamp? Did you see the witch?" Elžbieta motioned for them to speak. Ash and Tilly looked at one another. Ash put out a hand towards Tilly.  

Tilly cleared her throat, "Well, when we got down into the swamp, first we saw the witches hut, it was misty and cold. We followed the edge of the swamp. The witch appeared out of nowhere. She was the most beautiful and scary thing I have ever seen; she said her name is Grimelda. Then she told us where Imogen was, how to get to the dam and to hurry."  

"So, the mink that Imogen was chasing is the one who killed the missing cuy and the beaver flooded the swamp with a dam. And Imogen fell into the beaver dam tracking the mink. So, the witch did nothing after all?" Elžbieta looked at Ash and Tilly; they shook their heads in agreement.  

Tilly looked lovingly at Elžbieta, Milo, and Imogen. Then she turned to Ash and said, "Going with you on your heroes' adventure made me want to be an adventurer too. Can I journey east with you to find the knights?" Her face was glowing, looking into Ash's eyes.  

"Yes!" said Ash, he put a hand on her shoulder. "If Longbrook can let you go I'd be honored for you to come with me." Ash looked to the cheering crowd and said, "The witch disabled me with her magic, I was out cold. Tilly handled her alone, just to let everyone know what courage she showed and that she is the reason Imogen got home safe." The crowd cheered and yelled her name; Tilly bashfully laughed.  

Elžbieta looked around and said, "Tonight we will celebrate with a feast, and we can see you two off in the morning." This set off another round of cheering.  


 
Tilly and Ash walked to the dining hall together. Colored banners and lanterns hung on buildings and lamp posts all over town. Wind chimes and bells were hung, creating what Ash imagined fairy music would sound like, as they swayed and bumped in the breeze. "This is our heroes' celebration," said Ash. They both stood a little taller as they walked into the dining hall.  

To Ash, the bright banners and lanterns lining the walls looked magical. The ceiling of the dining hall was covered with fairy lights. Looking into them was like looking into the stars, like a deep pool of distant flickering candles. Ash had never been celebrated like this. He felt humbled by the outpouring.  

They sat and ate. Ash got more tastes of the best food he'd ever eaten.  

Milo sat with them, "I'll take care of mink proof upgrades," he said with a laugh.  

Someone asked Tilly what the witch was like, Tilly told them, "She was beautiful and powerful and terrible all at the same time. Her dress was elegant and flowed in the wind. She has the power to knock out a man by raising her hand and she can appear and disappear at will." She continued the tale right through saving Imogen. By the end some were cheering some were crying  

They all laughed and joked and ate and drank into the evening. When everyone went home for the night, they had full bellies and full hearts. The entire village walked home, smiling. Ash tucked into his warm bed roll, aware that this might be the last warm room he sleeps in for a while. He chuckled and rolled over to sleep.  


 
The next morning, as the sun was peeking over the horizon. Ash and Tilly walked up to the group of villagers who had gathered to see them off. The crowd parted to let the adventurer's pass.  

"Take care of each other out there," said a teary eyed Elžbieta. She gave Tilly a long goodbye hug.  

Milo and Levant were there, waving their goodbye. 

"Thank you," said Ash.  

Tilly looked at Elžbieta, Milo, Levant, and the crowd and said, "I love you." Then she turned and started walking away. Ash smiled at everyone then turned and walked to catch up to her. A chorus of 'goodbye' and 'be safe' faded behind them.  

They came to the main road and soon passed out of the forest to open green fields. Golden tall grass swayed in the wind and swallows flew in great looping arcs in the sky.  


   
 

Somewhere west of Longbrook village, a robot came back to life. A series of beeps and ticks started whirring from within its chest. It turned onto the main road. A cloud of dust fell from him and blew away in the wind. The robot started walking east...

# Echoes in the Sub-Station

*Ash finished packing his bag and slung it over his shoulder. The fire was low but still burning, Tilly wasn't there. He slid his backpack off of his shoulder and set it back on the ground. Gathering sticks he threw them on top of the coals, the flames wrapping around them.*

** Ash called Tilly’s name;** a large crow launched from a nearby tree, its wings whooshing as it flew away. Rising above the tree tops it disappeared from view. 

"Ash, I'm almost there," her voice came from the woods. A few seconds later Tilly pushed through the underbrush holding a fish in each hand, "I caught breakfast!" 

Ash smiled. "Perfect timing. How did you catch those?"

"I woke up early, I've been fishing since before sunrise." Tilly’s furry Kithren face shining with pride. She fashioned roasting skewers and set both fish to cook over the flames.

They had been traveling for weeks. Tilly had a slight limp, Ash thought she might be walking on blisters. And they were nearly out of supplies. We'll stop in the next town, he thought.

They both sat on their packs. Tilly turned the fish over and held her hands out to the fire to warm them.

Ash looked to Tilly and said "We'll stop in the next town we come across, replenish supplies, maybe wash our clothes."

"That would be great," said Tilly, turning the fish again, "These are looking good, almost done," she rubbed her belly.

Tilly handed one of the skewers to Ash; it smelled buttery and sweet.

They finished eating and put their packs and bedrolls on. Extinguishing the fire they walked towards the main road. 

Birds sang and  squirrels ran about, filling the air with chatter. The day was starting out warm, haze softened the view. Stands of trees were speckled between hills and fields, fading off to gentle blue rolling mountains in  the distance. 

Tilly motioned to Ash, "What do you think these tracks are?" 

Ash looked, "Hmm... They're small, cloven-hooved, I don't know what made them though, smaller than a deer."



Walking east meant that the sun was in their eyes every morning, so they didn't see the structure ahead until they were upon it. It was a sprawling one story building, made of concrete. Tall, golden, grasses with bristle heads grew from the gutters. The door was rusted and broken; there was a hole where the doorknob should have been. Little Kithren footprints led into and out of the building.

Ash pushed the door open, the dust coated hinges creaked.

Tilly took a step backward. "We shouldn't go in, it looks dangerous." 

Ash peaked his head into the door, "let's just look, the door's open." He stepped inside, it smelled of metal and dust. He looked around, eyes adjusting to the dark. It was just one large room. Machines and counter-tops lined the walls. Slowly forms came into view; there were many tables with many machines. Something on the floor at the center of the room caught his eye, an orb.

Tilly said, "I'll stay out here," not trusting the sharp metallic smells of the place. 

"There's something in the center of the room, I'm gonna check it out." Ash looked at Tilly. 

She nodded her head in silent agreement. "Be careful," she said.

Ash walked on the undisturbed dust towards the object. There was a perfect sphere half submerged in the floor. Ash reached out and touched it, the sphere started emitting a soft glow. Machines around the room came to life. Ash had a panicked look on his face. 

A female voice spoke over a loudspeaker, "Foundry-node 47... standby... rebooting..." Pulsing light cascaded down the sides of the glowing sphere.

Panicked, Ash said, "don't come in here!"

"I won't," said Tilly, breathing heavily. "You should come out of there." She made a 'come here' motion with her hands. Ash started to carefully walk back to the door. 

On the other side of the room something slid open. Ash turned to see what it was and bumped into a table. Two heavy feet stepped onto the floor. Ash froze, heart pounding.

A calm modulated voice crackled from  across the room, "hello, is anyone there?" The lights flickered on, a robot was looking at Ash. "Your identification please," said the bot in a calm, monotone voice. 

Ash tried to run but slipped in the thick dust. He fell onto the ground landing hard on his hip. A thick cloud of dust engulfed him; he choked and coughed, dust stung his eyes blinding him. The robot walked closer.

Tilly ran in, grabbing Ash by the hand and pulled him towards the door. He crawled forward trying to stand up, blind, slipping on the smooth dust. 

The Robot pressed forward. "Do you have identification?"

Tilly looked at it with startled eyes and pulled Ash frantically. He regained his footing and they stumbled out of the door into the daylight. They were prepared to run as the robot closed the distance. He didn't walk out of the door; he started walking around checking on machines. Other smaller robots emerged into the room making whooshing noises; they were leaving clean paths as they went. Tilly and Ash watched, marveling at the procession.

Ash, covered in dust, started wiping and beating at his pants and shirt, grey clouds billowed and blew away in the wind. He removed his cloak and shook another cloud of dust from it.

The robot stepped out of the door. "Are either of you technicians?" it asked.

"No," they said in unison. 

"We are travelers," said Ash. "Just traveling by," he looked at Tilly with a sly smile, raising his eyebrows and shoulders. 

The robot removed the door from its hinges and carried it around the side of the building. He came back around the corner without the door and went back inside. 

Ash looked at Tilly, raising his eyebrows and shoulders again, this time with a questioning frown. Tilly smiled, they watched the robot team cleaning the large dusty station. One of the small cleaning bots rolled past the doorway, its twirling bristles spinning beneath. 

Ash said, "I guess we should keep going," motioning towards the road.

"What's that?" asked Tilly, noticing something westward down the road. "Was someone walking behind us?" A lone figure approached. "We haven't been here long, they must have been close behind."

"Probably better if we wait here to see who they are, hopefully they just keep walking," said Ash. "Maybe it’s a technician? Win win," he chuckled.




They were both nervous as the character drew near. At first it appeared to be a cloaked human but as it got closer they saw it was a robot. 

"I think that's the robot I saw on the road before I got to your village. He was motionless, I thought he was broken." Ash didn't know what to make of it 'following' them. "Hello!" he said loud enough for the approaching robot to hear. Ash felt Tilly move closer to him, she bumped into his leg.

"Hello?" the robot called back, voice crackling and modulating in a wavering cadence.

Ash and Tilly looked at one another, both looked happily surprised by how friendly he sounded. 

The robot said, "I’m here to access this foundry. I'm a technician." The robot walked right past them into the building. They watched the technician introduce himself to the foundry bot, who proceeded to run some sort of diagnostics on him.  

Tilly turned to Ash and asked, "did that really just happen?" She looked at the robots in the foundry, then back at him. 

 "Coincidence, I guess," said Ash. They both laughed. 

They watched as the technician stepped into a large cabinet, the cabinet doors slid shut, enclosing him. The foundry robot was performing maintenance on pieces of machinery. The cleaning bots were cleaning; they had flexible tubes that looked like limbs, that were sucking the dust off of tables and countertops.

The doors to the technicians cabinet slid open and he walked out. He walked across the room right towards them. 




"I'm Ash," said Ash, it was all he could think of doing.

"I'm Tilly," she piped in.

"I'm Timothy," said  the technician. He turned and started walking away across the large field.

"Wait a sec," said Ash. "Where are you going?"

Timothy stopped and turned, "My power-core is nearly depleted, the foundry cannot replicate a new one. There is a power sub-station a few miles to the south of here, there may be a power-core there." He turned and started walking again. 

Ash looked at Tilly, eyebrows raised, silently asking if they should go; Tilly shook her head yes. 

"Can we come along, can we help?" asked Ash.

"Sure, my systems are faltering, I could shut down again." Timothy reasoned.




The three of them walked across the field and into the woods, sticks and leaves crunched under foot. Timothy was moving a bit slow and his voice had a slight treble.

Timothy turned to them and asked "Why did you two decide to come with me?" 

Ash thought for a moment, "We're adventurers, it sounded like an adventure.”.

"And we're headed east to train under great knights," added Tilly.

Timothy tilted his head and said "The knights Artorius and Siff? I live in the east, I know them, they are an imposing duo." 

Ash and Tilly exchanged glances. Ash asked, "Do you know the knight Orion?"

"No, he lives in the east as well but I've never met him. I know Siff and Artorius because I'm friends with their daughter Magdaline."

After walking for hours, through wooded areas, through fields, across streams, they came upon a rise where they could see a building in the distance with a tall antenna rising from its roof. 

Timothy pointed to it across the valley and said, "there it is, the sub-station."

They navigated down the wooded hillside, leaf litter slippery under foot. The sun was tipping to the west lengthening the shadows. 

Ash got Tilly's attention and pointed out a track in the mud. It looked like the same cloven track that she had pointed out on the road.

They could see activity at the sub station, It looked like there were some Kithren moving about.

"Hello," Timothy called to the station in his wavering cadence, his voice sounded like it was getting worse.

A voice called from the sub-station across the valley. "You're gonna want to get over here before the demon pigs come."  

The three picked up their pace but Timothy was having trouble keeping up. His metal foot slipped and wedged between two logs. They stopped while he pulled and tried to wiggle it free. Ash lifted one of the logs to help free his foot.

They walked up to the sub-station and a small group of Kithren stood outside.




"You will have to come inside with us, I am Gulnare, what are the three of you doing way out here?" Gulnare and his companions looked at the three of them with suspicion. 

Timothy stepped forward and said, "I am Timothy and these are my friends, Ash and Tilly,"

Gulnare and his group were a bit larger than Tilly's people, waist tall to Ash. This group had large canines, giving them a menacing look, they were furry faced and had a dark mask of fur around their eyes.

 Timothy asked Gulnare, "What are the demon pigs?"

"They will be here soon, as soon as the sun is below the mountains, before it gets dark," said one of Gulnare's companions. "These pigs have been terrorizing our village for more than a year; we left to get supplies and maybe find a solution. They trapped us here two days ago. We barely made it here and we don't know if we'd make it back."

Ash saw more of the tracks on the ground that were like the ones he and Tilly had seen on the road. Demon pigs, he thought to himself.

As the sun sank behind the mountains they started to hear snorting, grunting and  barking noises approaching.

Gulnare motioned and his companions followed him with Tilly, Ash and Timothy behind. "Let's go inside, we'll be able to see them through the windows."  Gulnare's group shut and barred the door once everyone was inside. They all climbed a metal staircase to get a view outside and watched as furry pigs started to appear from behind trees. They were heading straight towards them. 

Timothy counted more than fifty of these ‘demon pigs’ appearing out of the forest. The peccaries, the little pigs, ran up to the building, sniffing and snorting at the door, some ramming at it with their stout heads. 

"I don't know," said Timothy, "I'm picking up strange power sources, I think something is making them aggressive. We should explore, find a power-core and maybe we'll find the energy source that's driving them crazy. I am picking up a high pitched frequency."




"This building has underground levels we haven't explored," said Gulnare to Timothy. "It's really dark down there."

Ash said, "we have a lantern," Tilly took her backpack off and dug out the lantern she carried. She removed the flint and tinder and prepared to light it.

Timothy stopped her saying "I can ignite that,"  holding a single finger out. Tilly opened the glass door and held the lanterns exposed wick towards him. He lit the wick with his finger. A thin stream of black smoke rose from the flame. The smell of soot filled the air. 

Everyone in Gulnare's group looked at one another, eyes wide, heads nodding yes.

Timothy motioned to the stairwell. "We should go." 

Tilly handed the lantern to Timothy, he opened the stairwell door and started walking down the stairs. The metal creaked below his feet. Everyone followed: Timothy, then Gulnare and his group, then Tilly, with Ash taking up the rear.

At the bottom  of the stairs was a door. Timothy tried to turn the knob, it was locked. He put a finger against the lock, making buzzing and whizzing noises, then the lock clicked. Timothy turned the knob, it opened.




They walked through the door, the room on the other side looked exactly like the foundry. Timothy walked to the center of the room and touched the orb there. 

A female voice, the same as the one at the foundry said "sub-station-node 50... standby... rebooting..." The glowing sphere pulsed, light cascading down its sides. The overhead lights flickered on. Doors slid open on a cabinet that sat against one of the walls. 

Timothy stepped forward looking into the empty cabinet, "the steward is not here!"

Tilly asked Timothy, "Do you need the steward to fix your power-core?" 

"I do not need the steward to replace my  power-core, this station has the needed resources  to replicate one." Timothy replied. "I wonder where he went."

Timothy stepped into the cabinet, the doors slid closed. Three cleaning bots came out of small cubicles and got to work, buzzing and whirring. Gulnare's group looked startled. 

Gulnare with a snarl said, "Anora, my daughter, stay by me."

"Don't worry," said Tilly, "They're just cleaners, we've seen them before." She approached one of the bots to show it wasn't dangerous. Ash nodded his head in agreement.

The cleaning bots all stopped suddenly. Tilly noticed and nudged Ash, pointing to one of them.

The door to the hallway slid shut and the lights dimmed to an eerie golden amber. Tilly ran to the door that led to the hallway, it was locked.

Ash called to the closed cabinet doors, "Timothy! The power is out and the door to the ladder is locked, are you okay? Did you get fixed in there?" 

"My power-core has not been replaced; the maintenance chamber seems to have lost power." Timothy's voice was muffled talking through the chamber door. "I think the steward must have gone down the maintenance shaft. If I'm correct he may have gone to repair something and something went wrong. It could be dangerous but I think one of you may need to go down to see if you can help."

Ash called in to Timothy, "I'll go down," he said, with a resolute look on his face. "Where's the hatch?" 




Gulnares' companions looked at one another, "We will go to," he growled.

Timothy said, "The hatch is near this chamber module that I'm trapped in, you should see a grate on the floor." 

The Kithren found the hatch grate. With one on each corner they lifted it off of the floor. Ash took the lantern and climbed down the ladder. Tilly and Gulnares' group followed. Ash reached the bottom of the ladder and stood looking down a dark corridor.

 Ash called out, "Hello... steward?" His voice echoing down the concrete tunnel, he shivered in the chill.

From down the long hallway a light flashed and a broken and crackling voice said, "Hello... is anyone... there?"

"We're right here!" Called Tilly, "we're coming to help you."

The group ran down the dimly lit hallway; crackling sounds and a flashing light lit the steward. A bank of lights blinked on the console of the apparatus he had been repairing. He was melted into a braid of what looked like power cables. 

Ash approached the steward. "How do we help?" 

Tilly asked, "Are you hurt?"

"I am not... hurt, I do not feel pain," said the steward. "But I am trapped here."

Ash asked the steward, "Did something break? Is that why everything shut down?" 

Tilly tugged on Ash's leg and waved him down to listen to her. Ash bent down towards Tilly and she whispered in his ear, "He must have been trapped when we got here. We should ask if 'he' shut the power off," Tilly tilted her head, eyebrows raised, questioning.

Ash said, "steward, did you lock us down here?"

Gulnare growled, "is this a trap?" His group of Kithren looked at one another, a flash of action in their eyes.

The steward paused, "I did not mean to trap you in here with me..." his crackling voice faltering. "Something was drawing a lot of power... I had to shut it down... If the station runs out of power I will... die... I am trapped here." 

"Our friend Timothy needs a power-core," Ash told the steward. "He's stuck in the repair cabinet upstairs."

"Is your friend... a technician?" The steward asked.

"He is," said Tilly, "steward, what is this power station and what was the foundry, and what is a technician, what is all of this?"




The steward explained. "The sub-stations... help maintain the foundrys; the foundrys help the technicians... fulfill their protocols." The steward said in a broken crackling voice. "I should shut myself down... my function... is to help the technicians... the technicians repopulate the world... but... the longer I go without maintenance, the more bugs I get... the more I want to live..."  admitted the steward.

Ash said, "Steward, we will save you," with a serious look on his face.

Tilly interjected, "Ash,  we can't promise that. Steward, we can promise to uphold your choice."

Anora stepped forward raising her hands, "Quiet, I can hear the demon pigs." Snorts, grunts, and squeals were echoing through ventilation shafts. "Steward, something is driving the peccaries mad, even if we get out of here they will attack us. Do you know anything about this?"

The steward shook his head. "My ultrasonic sensor module is... failing. ...I am emitting high frequency sounds... this must be what is making them crazy." The steward paused, "so it is clear..."

Gulnare stepped towards the steward, "You must shut down for my people."

Anora got in front of him. "Dad, we can't ask him too." she said.

Ash looked at the steward and declared, "no, steward, we will find a way."

"No, steward," said Tilly, "we will honor your wishes!" She looked at Gulnare and Ash defiantly.

The steward spoke up, "stop... everyone..." The power came back on, "It's clear that I have to... be shut down..."

Gulnare grabbed the stewards shoulder and said, "I am sorry robot, you are brave, I honor your spirit." Anora, and the rest of the Kithren nodded in agreement.




The lights came back on, Ash extinguished  the lantern and handed it to Tilly to put in her backpack. They could hear the noises of machines running coming from the sub-station above, then the echoes of Timothy climbing down the metal maintenance ladder. 

His footsteps got closer until he appeared in the doorway. Timothy looked at the steward and asked, "will we be able to save you? If you can't survive then this sub-station will go off-line possibly creating a  domino effect on other nodes."

"Timothy, not only will I not survive... but I need to be shut down immediately... to stop emitting the frequency that's driving the peccaries mad," said the steward. "I fear that there may be no way... to prevent a shutdown cascade event..." 

Tilly asked, "what happens if the Sub-Stations shut down? What do they do?" 

Timothy waited until he had everyone's attention, "there was a world before this one," he explained, "but all the life died... We have spent a long time re-seeding, bit by bit. The Foundry's and Sub-Stations were built by the people from before and now we use them to provide resources for the re-seeding. They built the stewards, the technicians and all the robots." 

Tilly, with real concern on her face, asked, "Did they all die?"

"Yes," said Timothy, "everyone and everything died." He waited, letting the statement linger. Then Timothy turned to the steward and said, "I have an idea, we could try to upload you to the Sub-Station. You would persist but without your physical body to perform maintenance the facility will fail. But this should give me time to reach the next facility." Timothy looked to Ash and Tilly and asked "you two are heading east? Should we all travel together?"

The peccaries could still be heard puffing and snorting through the vents. "We can't leave with them out there," said Gulnare.

"You're correct," said Timothy, "I will remove your chip steward and I'll install it in the foundry's main console." The steward leaned forward as Timothy approached.

Anora pushed towards the steward, "Wait! Will this kill him?" A look of panic on her face.

"No, he will become part of the foundry," said Timothy. He removed the stewards chip, his robot form slumped forward. The noises from the peccaries echoing down the ventilation shafts went quiet. "Let me install the steward in the foundry then I will check outside to make sure it's safe." Timothy walked off down the hallway to the ladder.

Tilly and Anora paused in front of the stewards lifeless form. "Goodbye," said Tilly. Both Anora and Tilly gently put their hands on the robots cold metal frame. As Ash and the Kithren walked down the corridor they could hear Timothy climbing the metal ladder to the station above.




Ash climbed out of the maintenance shaft following Gulnare and his companions. Timothy stood at a console inputting information. Machines started to whir to life; consoles blinked and beeped. 

Timothy stepped back from the console, "Steward, are you there?" 

Tilly and Anora were the last to climb up the ladder, everyone paused, waiting for his response.

"I'm here," the stewards' voice came through the intercom. 

Everyone cheered, laughing and patting each other's backs.

Timothy looked at Gulnare and gave a quick nod then he strode to the door and walked outside. He walked back in and said, "they are gone!" Everyone cheered again. 

"Thank you all," said Gulnare. "We can now return home. The three of you saved us and our village, If you want to come back to our village, we don't have much, but we can repay you with hospitality."

"Thank you Gulnare but I need to go east." Timothy told him.

"We're sticking with him," said Ash, "I'm so glad we met you and that we could help, though in truth, we all helped each other. It took all of us to solve the problem."

Gulnare and Anora and the rest walked off into the forest. Timothy, Tilly and Ash watched them go, Anora turned and waved, all three waved back. The early morning light gave Anora a magical glow.

Timothy turned and walked back into the sub-station, "steward, thank you for your service," He said.

The stewards voice crackled over the intercom again, "thank you Timothy, and Ash and... Tilly, I would have just... shut down alone if you hadn't found me. I'll be able to keep the sub-station running from here... for a little while, certainly long enough for you to get to the next node. I wish you all luck, thank you."

The three of them left the sub-station crunching across the leaf litter on the forest floor. Soft damp smells drifted as they walked. Chickadees landed on branches singing their chicka-dee-dee song. 




Miles ahead a lone figure stood by a low fire. His inky blue armor scratched and dented, he faced his captives. The bandits were tied to a tree, whimpering. 

"Please let me go," one of them begged. The air was thick with the smell of iron.

The Gloam Knight turned back to the fire and sat down; He didn't answer their pleas. He drew his sword and started cleaning it, the sword's blade reflecting in the firelight. They would find no mercy here, not tonight.

# Enter Gloam Knight

*Tilly was hunched over at a small stand of mushrooms foraging their next meal. She could smell the damp moss and browning leaf litter. The setting sun hurried her picking and collecting. Putting the last of the mushrooms into her sack, she walked back to the camp.*

**Timothy and Ash** sat by a crackling fire. Tilly walked up and opened her pouch to show off her spoils, it was filled with a mix of berries, mushrooms and greens. 

"Looks good!" Ash pulled jerky and dried bread from his pack.

Tilly got out bowls and started dividing the food between them, leaving some for breakfast. A thought occurred to her, she asked, “Timothy, how old are you?”

“I’m not sure,” he replied. “Thousands of years I’d guess. The more time that goes by the more my system is corrupted, every fix and rewrite is a chance for further corruption. I imagine that I knew at some point in the past.”

“Does that mean you’ll eventually forget who you are?” Ash questioned.

“I could,” Timothy replied. “Some forget who they are, some forget their purpose, some malfunction and just shut down.”

Tilly handed Ash a bowl, she was contemplating the implications of living so long, Ash swapped with her pieces of bread and jerky. 

Ash was thinking about the many ways that a robot could unravel, if any system could be corrupted at any time. They both ate, satiating their hunger from the day's trek.

They laid out their packrolls and tucked in for the night. Timothy too shut down his system for what he called his, “nightly defragment”. 

                                                              ***

The sun woke them shining through the trees just cresting the mountains in the distance. Tilly tossed some berries on the  ground near camp for the birds to eat. Small songbirds were flying and twittering about; juncos, chickadees, and nuthatches, all flew about singing their songs. Some picked at and ate the small berries, Tilly watched them in reverence. 

Tilly and Ash rolled and tied their pack rolls and all three of them sat by the extinguished fire while they ate the rest of their food from the night before. A brave chickadee landed on Timothy's shoulder, they all laughed in sweet surprise. Startled, the chickadee flew away.

“Well, I guess that’s our cue to leave.” Said Ash, standing he slung his pack over his shoulder. Tilly and Timothy stood too, Tilly suiting up her backpack and packroll. They all walked towards the road leaving the small birds to pick up any scraps from the encampment.

Walking out of the woods they stepped back onto the road. Ash stretched looking east, walking hadn’t been bad, they seemed to have found a good pace. Tilly was fast, even with her short strides She stayed between Ash, in the rear, and Timothy in the lead.

 A robin hopped around the base of a sign beside the road, it found a worm pulling it from the ground and flying away. Timothy stopped looking at the sign; it was a single stake with a board nailed to the top. On the board was a sun half behind mountains. It was a simple design, white paint on bare wood.

“Have either of you heard of the Gloam Knight?” Timothy asked them.

“No,” they both replied in unison.

“Well this is his symbol, he patrols this section of the road.” Timothy paused and looked at Tilly, then he looked at Ash. “He protects innocent people but he isn’t a good knight, he has bad intentions.” 

Ash and Tilly glanced at one another, Ash had never heard of a bad knight, well, Timothy did say that he protected people. But he also said that he had ‘bad intentions’ whatever that would mean.

They kept walking through the midday heat, sun directly above. A few miles ahead the road entered a forest that would offer them shade, he and Tilly had both taken off their cloaks and had rolled up their sleeves. Sweat soaked Ash’s shirt and hair. 

An eagle circled far above in the sky, Ash closed his eyes trying to imagine its view. For a moment he was there, high above the long stretch of road, fields and trees then mountains stretching away to either side. He imagined the cool air blowing against him as he flew in the sky. He looked upon the forest ahead but couldn’t see what lay beyond.

Ash looked at Tilly and Timothy thinking about how lucky he was to have met his companions. It felt like the fates themselves were pushing him forward; prompting every move as if on script of some magical story.

Ash heard the familiar call from a morning dove up ahead, ‘who, who, who-a-who, who’. Two doves were together pecking at the dirt at the road's entrance to the forest. Like a streak, something shot out of the sky and crashed into them. A cloud of road dust and feathers erupted from the ground. An eagle flew off in one direction, a lone morning flew in another.

Ash ran over to investigate but all that was left was some scuffled dirt and feathers, a few of which were still drifting to the ground when he got to the spot where the doves had been. “Well, I guess an eagle’s gotta eat too,” he said, shrugging. Tilly shook her head yes, giving Ash a solemn look.

They entered the forest greeted by the shade and a cooling breeze. A clanging noise echoed through the forest; jarring metal striking something, clang, clang, clang!

Ash noticed a torn piece of cloth hanging from a branch, it was spattered with dark stains. He cringed a bit hoping the stains weren’t blood..

“What is that noise!” Tilly was clearly bothered by the banging, her furry ears twitching with every knock. “It’s just creepy, it is knocking but it’s inviting us to go towards it and it feels off, like it’s leading towards something bad.”

“It sounds like it could be metal striking metal, against a rock?” Timothy said, alert and listening. “It does feel ominous, it's very unnatural to hear in the forest.”

Ash wondered if it had something to do with the Gloam Knight. It sounded bad, the clang, clang. He peered through the trees, eyes vigilant. Searching for, he didn’t know what. But they were all on edge, walking quietly, they stopped talking.

Then the clanging ended. “I think it stopped,” said Tilly, relaxing her shoulders. But she noted that no birds were singing, no chipmunks chattering. They continued on, the silence feeling just as unnatural as the clanging metal sound did.

                                                       ***

With only the sound of their footfalls crunching in the dirt they walked in Eerie silence.

Timothy halted, putting his hands out then raising a finger to his mouth; they all stopped and listened. Tilly could hear a high pitched ringing amidst the lack of noise. They all scanned through the trees. Timothy was staring off in a specific direction, Ash and Tilly noticed and started looking in that direction too.

“I thought I heard something,” said Timothy, still staring off into the trees.

Ash noticed Tilly’s ears twitching and Timothy said, “that’s it, someone's coming.” Then Ash could hear it too, footsteps crunching through the woods, getting louder as they approached. 

A man came into view. Tilly was startled when she saw him. He was walking right towards them.

“Hello.” Ash called, clearly nervous. As the character came closer Ash could see he was a knight. His cloak and armor, deep blue. 

In a quiet voice Timothy said, “This is Gloam Knight, he is scary but we’re not in danger. He doesn’t know who I am.”

“Hello travelers,” The knight said loudly, almost antagonistically, as he approached. “Are you all just traveling through?” His gruff voice landed like a terrible threat. The knight was walking fast, nearly upon them. He was fully armored, helmet to boots he was covered. All a shiny dark blue purple-ish hue, like an empty night sky after sunset, as if there should be stars.  

“We are traveling through,” said Timothy, “I am escorting my young friends here to the east. They want to apprentice under the knights Artorius and Siff.” 

“Okay, well, you all don’t look like trouble.” The gloam knight walked up, towering over them, he looked them all up and down. “I’ll escort you, this road can be dangerous, ‘lots of bandits about.” 
“Great,” Timothy said, “better safe than sorry.” He looked at Ash and Tilly, they both smiled nervously.

They continued on, the sound of the Gloam knights jangling armor now a part of their sounds as they moved through the creepily quiet forest.   


[Fill out walking/meeting Gloam Knight section a bit]


				***

Deep in the forest a creature of darkness and gloom prowled. Its hulking form, equally fast and quiet. Leaves rustled as it brushed through them. It stopped, a twig snapping under its heavy feet.
